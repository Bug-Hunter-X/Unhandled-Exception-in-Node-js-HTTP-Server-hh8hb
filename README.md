This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in a Node.js HTTP server where unhandled exceptions lead to server crashes without informative error messages.  The bug is particularly challenging to debug because of the lack of clear error reporting. The solution involves robust error handling within the request listener to catch and gracefully handle unexpected data or errors, preventing server crashes and improving application resilience.
